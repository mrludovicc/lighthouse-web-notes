### Tips day 2
* Give your functions precise verb/action based names.
* Use camelCasedNames (like this one).
* Properly indent the function code.
* Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things:
  * One single task could be to compute and return a value (eg: zeroPad).
  * Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as logging a message to the screen (eg: printFarmInventory)
